    "Instead of storing all the intermediate values of $\\theta$, we only store the last $\\theta$ observed i.e. $\\theta_t$. This will save a lot of space. Also, to calculate the average $\\bar{\\theta}_t$, we will not have to loop over t. Calculating the value of $S_t$ along with $\\theta_t$, saves time in calculating $\\bar{\\theta}_t$, and reduces the complexity of $\\bar{\\theta}_t$ calculation from O(t) to O(1)."

    "The tagger usually does not perform as well for the tags that are less common like S, X, Z, all of which occur less than 10 times in the dataset. As mentioned earlier, some of the gold-standard tags in this example appear to be wrong. This can be one of the reasons why the tagger is not able to identify them correctly (for ex, 'burger', 'smash'). The performance is really poor for ~ (indications of continuation of a message across multiple tweets) and inspite of 170 occurances, the tagger still fails to get it right. The tagger identifies the tokens like \":\" as punctuations and not as discourse markers.\n"

    "Improve the features of your tagger to improve accuracy on the development set. This will only require changes to `local_emission_features`. Implement at least 4 new types of features. Report your tagger's accuracy with these improvements. Please make a table that reports accuracy from adding different features. The first row should be the basic system, and the last row should be the fanciest system. Rows in between should report different combinations of features. One simple way to do this is, if you have 4 different feature types, to run 4 experiments where in each one, you add only one feature type to the basic system. For example:\n",

    "Hint: if you make features about the first character of a word, that helps a lot for the # (hashtag) and @ (at-mention) tags.  The URL tag is easy to get too with a similar form of character affix analysis. Character affixes help lots of other tags too. Also, if you have a feature that looks at the word at position $t$, you can make new versions of it that look to the left or right of the $t^{th}$ position in question: for example, 'word_to_left=the'.\n"
